## First Task : Brick-Breaker Game 🧱

👋 

🎮 Using basic Java, I crafted this code from scratch and even developed a sleek GUI (Graphical User Interface) to enhance the gaming experience. But before we delve into the code, let's grasp the allure of Brick Breaker - a timeless classic where you control a paddle, bouncing a ball to demolish a wall of bricks while racking up points. 🧱🏓

Now, let's take a peek at the code in action. When executed, a new window pops up with dimensions 800x600. Inside, you'll find a bouncing ball and a paddle. Your mission? Protect the ball from falling using the paddle! And watch as the bricks crumble upon impact, adding an extra layer of excitement to the game.

## 🎮 How to Play:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the BrickBreaker.java file.
Enjoy the game! Use the arrow keys to move the paddle and prevent the ball from falling off the screen. Break as many bricks as you can to earn points.
