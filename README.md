## First Task : Brick-Breaker Game 🧱

👋 This project marks my debut in game development using Java. Inspired by the timeless classic Brick Breaker, I've crafted a simple yet captivating version complete with a graphical user interface (GUI).

🎮 Using basic Java, I crafted this code from scratch and even developed a sleek GUI (Graphical User Interface) to enhance the gaming experience. But before we delve into the code, let's grasp the allure of Brick Breaker - a timeless classic where you control a paddle, bouncing a ball to demolish a wall of bricks while racking up points. 🧱🏓

Now, let's take a peek at the code in action. When executed, a new window pops up with dimensions 800x600. Inside, you'll find a bouncing ball and a paddle. Your mission? Protect the ball from falling using the paddle! And watch as the bricks crumble upon impact, adding an extra layer of excitement to the game.

Curious to see it in action? Check out the video to witness the magic of the Brick Breaker Game in motion! 🚀💥

### 🎮 How to Play:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the BrickBreaker.java file.
Enjoy the game! Use the arrow keys to move the paddle and prevent the ball from falling off the screen. Break as many bricks as you can to earn points.
